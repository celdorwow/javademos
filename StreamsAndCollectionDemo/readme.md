### Important

in order for the project to work, there needs to be a `CSVParser` available. This project uses the `Apache Commons CSV` downloaded from [Apache Commons](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-csv/).

Simply open an archive and extract its content; it is a folder `commons-csv-1.8`. Import its libraries to the project. In IntelliJ, it is done in `Project Settings` -> `Libraries` by importing the whole folder and accepting defaults. The library should appear within `External Libraries`.
